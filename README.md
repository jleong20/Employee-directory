# Employee-directory

## Description

This app will take a list of employees and list them out as a directory. The user should be able to search the directory for the employee they are looking for and display the employee in the directory. The user should also be able to sort the directory by name in alphabetical order.

Although the application is still a work in progress, this application explores a directory for a list of employees using `props`, as the application matures, `props` will eventually be replaced with a context provider so all children components can access the API. 
`useReducer` will also replace the event listener for the search.
